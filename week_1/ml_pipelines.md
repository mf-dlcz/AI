# ML Pipelines
- A machine learning pipeline is a series of steps that work together to perform a machine 
learning task.

-Engineers design the pipeline to automatically do the different parts of creating a machine 
learning model.

A typical machine learning pipeline includes the following stages:

### Problem Formulation


### Data Gathering and Ingestion


### Data Preprocessing



***

## Model Tuning

### Feature Engineering


### Model Selection and Training


### Model Evaluation


### Content with Performance


_**Yes**_

### Model Deployment


### Monitoring


_**No**_

### Model Tuning
- All of the steps within Model Tuning will repeat.

# When to Use ML
- Machine learning transformed various domains, allowing new levels of automation, prediction, and decision-making.
- As developers, it's important for you to understand the trade-offs and carefully consider when machine learning is 
truly necessary.

## When AI and ML are Appropriate Solutions

### _Coding the Rules is Challenging_
- Many human tasks cannot be solved properly using simple, rule-based solutions.

- When rules rely on too many factors, have overlaps, or need to be finely tuned, it becomes difficult for humans to code 
    them accurately. 
    - ML can be used to effectively solve this kind of problem.

### _Scale of the Project is Challenging_
- Scaling through millions of lines would be tedious and inefficient.
    - ML solutions are appropriate for large-scale problems.

## Alternative Approaches to AI and ML
- Factors to consider when deciding to use ML. Consider data complexity, structured procedures, interpretability, data
availability and development and iteration speeds.

### _Simple Rule-Based Systems_
- For tasks with **well-defined rules and logic, use traditional rule-based systems.**
    - basic validation, formatting and simple decision-making doesn't need the use of ML.

### _Deterministic Calculations_
- For tasks involving calculations, math transformations, or algorithms, like sorting and searching, rule-based or formula-driven 
solutions might be better than machine learning models.
    - These tasks use structured procedures to reach a goal. 
    - Examples include currency conversions, interest rate calculations, and basic data aggregations. 

These tasks can be easily implemented using traditional programming techniques without the need for ML-driven approach.

### _Highly Regulated Domains_
- In domains with strict regulatory requirements, such as finance and healthcare, the need for interpretability and explainability 
of the decision-making process might make an ML-driven solution less desirable. 
    - A transparent, rule-based system might be preferred.

### _Small Datasets_
- ML models often require large amounts of high-quality data to perform well. 
    - For use cases with limited data availability, a traditional approach might be more effective than attempting to build 
    an ML model.

### Rapid Prototyping and Iteration
- When speed and flexibility are critical, such as during the early stages of product development, a non-ML solution 
might be more suitable.

# Components of a Prompt
The main components that make up common prompts include input data, instructions, context, 
and output indicators.

### <ins>Input Data<ins>
- Input data represents the actual information, query, or data that a model should process and 
generate output from.

- Input data fits into the user messages aspect of an interaction with AI.


### <ins>Instructions<ins>
- Instructions provide specific guidance to a model on how to approach a task or generate a 
desired output.

- Instructions usually fit into the system messages aspect of an interaction with AI.


### <ins>Context<ins>
- Context sets the scene or provides background information relevant to a task or query. 

- It helps a model understand the broader circumstances, domain knowledge, or real-world 
scenarios in which the input data should be interpreted. 

- Context usually fits into the system messages or user messages aspect of an interaction 
with AI.


### <ins>Output Indicators<ins>
- Output indicators specify an expected format, type, or characteristics of the output a model 
should generate based on input data and instructions.

- Output indicators usually fit into the system messages aspect of an interaction with AI. 


> [!NOTE]  
> By breaking down prompts into these components, you can effectively structure and communicate 
> your prompts to FMs and LLMs.  
> This approach ensures that models have the necessary information, context, and guidance to 
> accurately interpret input data and generate desired output, as intended.

# Using FMs and ML Models
Well discuss the difference between the two.


## When to use FMs
- FMs such as LLMs are examples of generative AI models.

- They have several advantages over traditional ML models.

Scenarios where it can be advantageous to us FMs.

### <ins>Open-ended NLP tasks<ins>
- FMs excel at open-ended NLP tasks, such as text generation, summarization, and question-answering, 
due to their ability to process and generate human-like text. 

- Traditional ML models are typically trained on specific tasks and struggle with open-ended 
language tasks that require understanding context and generating coherent responses.


### <ins>Few-shot and Zero-shot Learning<ins>
- FMs can adapt to new tasks with minimal or no additional training data, a capability known as 
few-shot or zero-shot learning. 
This is particularly useful when training data is scarce or costly to obtain. 

- Traditional machine learning models typically require large amounts of labeled data for each 
specific task, making them less flexible and more resource-intensive.


### <ins>Multi-modal Tasks<ins>
- Some FMs can handle multi-modal inputs, such as text and images. This makes it suitable for tasks 
like image captioning. 
It is also suitable for visual question answering and multimedia content generation.


### <ins>Rapid Prototyping and Exploration<ins>
- FMs can be easily adapted and fine-tuned for various tasks, which allows for rapid prototyping and 
exploration of new applications. 
This flexibility is valuable in research and development settings, where iterative experimentation is 
crucial. 

- Traditional ML models often require extensive feature engineering and model architecture design, 
which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.


### <ins>Domain Transfer and Generalization<ins>
- FMs trained on large, diverse datasets can potentially transfer knowledge across domains and 
generalize better to unseen data. 
This makes them suitable for applications that require domain adaptation or handling of 
out-of-distribution data. 

- Traditional ML models are often more specialized and might struggle with domain shifts or 
generalization to unseen data distributions.

> Additionally, traditional ML models may still outperform FMs in certain tasks or domains

## When to Use ML
Traditional ML models excel in scenarios where the data is well-structured and the task is well-defined.

FMs work better with unstructured data, like text.

# ML Pipelines
- A machine learning pipeline is a series of steps that work together to perform a machine 
learning task.

- Engineers design the pipeline to automatically do the different parts of creating a machine 
learning model.

- The pipeline takes in and prepares data.
    - It then trains the model on the processed data and evaluates how well the model
    performs.
    - It then trains the model so that others can use it.

A typical machine learning pipeline includes the following stages:

### Problem Formulation
- Is an essential initial step that involved clearly defining and understanding the problem to be
addressed.

- This stage identifies the learning problem type (supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement).

- It also determines the evaluation criteria, establishes data requirements, and identifies
constraints and assumptions.

- A well-formulated problem ensures that the machine learning solution aligns with business goals.

### Data Gathering and Ingestion
- In this stage you upload and import data from various sources.

- These sources can include databases, CSV files or APIs.

- Data is brought into the machine learning environment for further processing.

# Fundamentals of AI and ML
- Generative AI is part of Deep Learning, Deep Learning is part of Machine Learning, 
Machine Learning is part of AI.

## Artificial Intelligence
- Any system that can ingest human-level knowledge to automate and accelerate tasks 
performable by humans through natural intelligence.

- AI has two categories-narrow AI and general AI.

    - **Narrow AI** imitates human intelligence but it is _limited to one context._

    - **General AI** can learn and behave intelligently across _multiple contexts._

Examples of AI include:
- Document analysis in Amazon Comprehend

- Data and text extraction in Amazon Textract

## Machine Learning
- is a type of AI for understanding and building methods that make it possible for machines
to learn.

- These methods use data to improve computer performance on a set of tasks.

- ML is a way to develop statistical models that can learn and improve, without
explicit instructions.

- They learn patterns and model the relationship in data to complete tasks.

## Deep Learning
- This approach relies on a layered architecture that mimics human natural neurons, rather
than using statistical models in traditional machine learning.

-  Deep learning models can recognize complex patterns in pictures, text, sounds, and
other data to produce accurate insights and predictions.

- Data such as pictures, texts, sounds, is _unstructured data_.

- Tabular data is _structured data_.

## Generative AI
- Creates new content and ideas.

- Generates conversations, stories, images, videos, and music.

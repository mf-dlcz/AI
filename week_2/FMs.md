# Foundation Models
Generative AI is powered by models that are pre-trained on internet-scale data, and 
these models are called foundation models (FMs).

FMs are large, general-purpose models pretrained on vast amounts of diverse data, 
capturing broad knowledge and capabilities.

    - You can adapt or fine-tune these models for specific tasks or domains with 
    relatively small amounts of task-specific data and computational resources.
    - These tasks include text generation, text summarization, information 
    extraction, image generation, chat based assistant interactions, and question answering.

# Gen AI Architecture Patterns
Gen AI patterns
1. Content Generation
2. Summarization
3. Improved Search
4. Automation
5. Productivity


## Content Generation
Content generation involves making new things, like blog content, educational 
materials, and assessments.

1. propt input request
2. received request
3. fm
4. prepare response
4. generated output


## Summarization
Summarization involves extracting summaries and metadata by processing existing 
material, thus enhancing accessibility of legacy content. 

<ins>Extractive Summarization<ins>  
- Extractive summarization involves identifying and selecting the most important 
words, phrases, or sentences from a source document and then concatenating them 
to form a summary.

<ins>Abstractive Summarization<ins>
- Abstractive summarization involves generating new text that is not a rephrasing 
of the source document.

-  It consists of creating new text summaries that capture the key ideas and 
elements of the source text.

1. small files
2. receive request
3. fm
4. prepare response
5. summarized output


## Improved Search
Improved search involves interpreting different types of datasets to provide 
accurate information from unstructured sources. 

1. input question
2. receive request
3. retrieve
4. knowledge base
5. fm
6. prepare response
7. generated answer


## Automation
Automation involves planning and deployment through agents and functions for 
diverse tasks.

The models can be trained to recognize patterns, make decisions, and perform actions based 
on the provided inputs.

One way automation happens is through function calls or agents. An agent refers to a 
software system or component that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take 
actions to achieve specific goals or complete tasks. An agent is essentially a program or set 
of functions that interacts with a generative AI model. It receives outputs or actions from 
the model. The agent uses the outputs to perform tasks or operations.

1. user input
2. receive request
3. automation workflow (function calls or agents)
4. FM
5. automation workflow (function calls or agents)
6. prepare response
7. app response


## Productivity
Productivity involves offering assistance in various applications, ranging from 
coding to business intelligence.

1. input request
2. receive request
3. application (productivity tool)
4. FM
5. prepare response
6. generated output
